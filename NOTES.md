### To Run XbrTest Successfully:

If you have the exact files checked out with no changes the test should run green. If you change any files you will need to change the test assertion from "true" to "false".

### Reference

 * This project is a super simple implementation of the docs found at [the camel-git component](http://camel.apache.org/git.html)
 * A feature of reading in git.properties is also added, but then it isn't consumed in a meaningful way except as a test
